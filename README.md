MusicalStructure (Project 4) for "Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program" - (EU Scholarship) by Udacity

## Project Overview
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making the structure of a music app using intents and empty activities.

The goal is to design and create the structure of a Music app which would allow a user to play audio files. There are many music player apps, and they make a wide variety of design choices. It will be your job to decide what kind of music app your structure would turn into and build out that structure using intents. Will you build an app to play music from the user’s library of music? Will you build an app to stream random songs from a database? Will you build a musical suggestion engine? Those choices are up to you!

## What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
* Creating new activities
* Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app.
* Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.

**The required components for this project are:**
* App should have 3 to 6 Activities
* Each Activity contains a TextView explaining the Activity and the buttons that allow the user to change Activity
* One of those Activities is a Payment Activity. For this Activity, find an external library or API that can be used in this situation. In the TextView of this activity, describe the library or API and how it can be used.
